# Spray_Arduino

A repo for creating an Arduino-controlled spray system

The intended use case is SprayLD - a room temperature and vacuum-free method of depositing a single monolayer of nanoparticles or quantum dots at a time
This is particularly useful for solar cell production, and can be scaled from lab scale to factory-scale as it is compatible with a continuous manufacturing line

Dependencies:
- ArduinoJSON (v5)

Info on commits:
- Master branch now requires settings to be set over serial
- For a simpler mode of operation, where the Arduino settings are programmed at compile time, please checkout commit 750aeafd341a7cbec68076154e8be77833e0359a 

For more info on SprayLD and hardware setup, please see my thesis (URL to be updated)
