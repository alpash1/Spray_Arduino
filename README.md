# Spray_Arduino

A repo for creating an Arduino-controlled spray system

The intended use case is SprayLD - a room temperature and vacuum-free method of depositing a single monolayer of nanoparticles or quantum dots at a time
This is particularly useful for solar cell production, and can be scaled from lab scale to factory-scale as it is compatible with a continuous manufacturing line
